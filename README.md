The goal is to create a Simple chat bot that runs on my local maschine by connecting a local LLM to a frontend.
I hope to get a better understanding of LLMs and of request handling within a backend.

This is a learning project before i start with backend server communication within my ToDoList project.

Technologies used:
- Backend: Flask
- FrontEnd: Vue
- LLM: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b
